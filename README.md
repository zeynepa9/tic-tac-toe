# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game developed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe#building-a-house-from-the-inside-out) curriculum. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is designed to be played in the web browser. 

[Live Demo](https://zeynepa9.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

## Overview

The game features a classic Tic-Tac-Toe experience where two players can play against each other. The gameboard is represented as an array within a `Gameboard` object, and the players are stored in separate objects. The main focus of this project is to minimize the use of global code by encapsulating functionalities within factories and modules.

## Features

- Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game playable in the browser.
- Clean and user-friendly interface.
- Functionality to add player names and restart the game.
- Display updates to show the current status and results of the game.
- Logic to prevent players from marking already occupied spaces.

## Technologies

- **HTML**: For structuring the game's content.
- **CSS**: For styling the game's interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing game logic and DOM manipulations.

## Lessons Learned

This project emphasized the importance of organizing and structuring code effectively. Key takeaways include:

- Organizing game logic using objects and factory functions.
- Encapsulating functionalities to reduce global scope pollution.
- Implementing game logic such as checking for wins or ties.
- Managing DOM elements and responding to user interactions.
- Developing a clean and intuitive user interface.

## Local Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to play the game.
